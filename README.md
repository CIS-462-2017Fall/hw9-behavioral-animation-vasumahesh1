## HW9

I completed the assigned Tasks.


#### Notes

I am using the code from my previous assignments, so I had them copied over. I haven't touched the Release version but the Debug works just fine.

Also, compiled on VS2017. If you have any build issues (since project was upgraded to VS2017), maybe try copying the files (h & cpp) to your test build.

Some of the DLLs might be missing due to the gitignore, but if I merge the libsrc with the rar file supplied on canvas, it works.

Thanks!
